            After the baccalaureate I had the passion to go into computer science at the same time but I couldn't. The objective not having changed, I took a scientific course which is maths. 
            During my course I had to do personal work on certain areas of IT. In the final year of my degree I had the opportunity 
            to work with the GDSC (Google Developer Students Clubs) team at my University as a Web Designer. After my degree I applied 
            for the ICCR scholarship which gave me the opportunity to continue my master's degree in Computer Science.
